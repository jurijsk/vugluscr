## TODO  ✅ ⬜

✅ implement thumb drugging on mouse down

🆗 do the packaging (works with textext when referenced locally for now). Install from github should work as well, but I did not tested it.

✅ css is embedded to js so it is one reference to make it work

✅ works without passing any elements, defaults to the whole page

⬜ make sure that scrollbar is hidden when it is not needed. Eg. https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox

⬜ make it work with infinite scroll e.g. twitter

⬜ restore markers

✅ ⬜ 🆗
